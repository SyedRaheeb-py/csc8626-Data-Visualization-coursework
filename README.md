# Power BI Coursework – UK Energy and CO2 Dashboard



Project Overview

This repository contains coursework for the CSC8626 - Data Visualization module, focused on designing interactive Power BI dashboards visualizing energy efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across the UK, segmented by property type, region, and more.



Report

A detailed project description sheet is provided in report/Report.pdf.



Dashboard Structure \& Key Tasks



1\. Location Task

* Map \& Bubble Chart: Interactive Azure Map with colored bubbles visualizing regional CO₂ emission by intensity and size.
* Stacked Bar Chart: CO₂ breakdown by region and property type.
* Slicers \& Cards: Filter property types; summary cards display highest/lowest emissions and efficiency.
* User Navigation: Dedicated buttons to shift between location, time, and multi-dimensional analyses.



2\. Time Task

* Multi-Series Line Chart: Shows evolution of energy efficiency over time by region.
* Region Slicer: Filters for selecting/zooming into multiple areas.
* Scatter Plot: Trends in energy efficiency by property type over time with slicers for property.
* Navigation Buttons: Seamless transition between dashboard tasks.



3\. Multi-Dimensional Analysis

* Scatterplot: CO₂ emission by property type and district.
* Matrix Table: Aggregated CO₂ by district/property, highlighted by color intensity.
* Dynamic Cards: Display max CO₂ emission per property in selected districts.
* District Slicers \& Navigation Buttons: Interactive filtering for in-depth insights.



Visualization Principles Applied

* Color Use: Sequential, color-blind and print-safe palettes (ColorBrewer), with distinct hues per property for clarity and accessibility.
* Graphic Design: Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity), visual hierarchy for insights, strategic use of size and position for attention guidance.
* Interaction:

&nbsp;	(a). Shneiderman's Mantra: "Overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand."

&nbsp;	(b). Multiple coordinated views for dynamic exploration.

&nbsp;	(c). Tooltips and navigation buttons for detailed and intuitive data exploration.

* Text \& Legends: Chunked titles, semantic clarity, short labels, clear legends and guidance, consistency in styling per context.
